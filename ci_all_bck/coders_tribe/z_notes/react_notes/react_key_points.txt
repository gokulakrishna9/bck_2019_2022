1)  User React + Redux
2)  routing{parent components{bunch of components, pass redux state change to components}}
3)  components{
      w3.css,
      react-router-dom
    }
4)  ideally-make this the builder{
      state should worry about {inserts, updates, deletes}->table columns,
      components should worry about event handling, passing state back to redux,
      form composer,
      grid composer a state value
    }
5)  for this app{
      header,
      leftnav,
      lazy loaded form,
      lazy loaded table
    }
