2)  Introduction
1.  fuzzyset is a data structure that performs something akin to fulltext search against data to determine likely mispellings and approximate string matching.
2.  Note that this is a javascript port of a python library.
3)  Usage
1.  The usage is simple. Just add a string to the set, and ask for it later by using .get:
+.  a = FuzzySet();
    a.add("michael axiak");
    a.get("micael asiak");
2.  The result will be an array of [score, matched_value] arrays.
3.  The score is between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect match.
